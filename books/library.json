      "summary": "This book made me think about the lack of structure in my life. Apparently, many famous artists had, actually, quite thought out routines. Also, many of them were creeps.",
      "highlights": [
        "On Auden: He was dismissive of night owls: “Only the ‘Hitlers of the world’ work at night; no honest artist does.",
        "On Auden: To maintain his energy and concentration, the poet relied on amphetamines, taking a dose of Benzedrine each morning the way many people take a daily multivitamin. At night, he used Seconal or another sedative to get to sleep.",
        "On de Beauvoir: It was an uncluttered kind of life, a simplicity deliberately constructed so that she could do her work.",
        "On Wolfe: he had been unconsciously fondling his genitals, a habit from childhood that, while not exactly sexual (his “penis remained limp and unaroused,” he noted in a letter to his editor)"
